# Workflow Code

You know, every coding guy should have its own workflow. And this is mine and I'm happy this one was realy helpful (to solve some craze bussiness logic).

    <p>
        The Workflow Code is intended to be used by developers.<br>
        As useful and simple as possible.<br>
        It is the Workflow framework for a fast and readable code.
    </p>
    <p>
        WorkflowCode is sutable for state-full applications builded by WPF, Silverlight, WinForms.<br>
        For me it is an additional tool to deal with complexity of the outside world.<br>

        <strong>Examples!</strong>
    </p>
    <blockquote>Workflow patterns usually get applied in various context, hence the conditions for use shall be explicitly defined and shown in example to prevent from misinterpreting.
