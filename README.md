# Workflow Code

You know, every coding guy should have its own workflow. And this is my and I'm happy this one was realy helpful (to solve some craze bussiness logic).

    <p>
        The Workflow Code is&nbsp;intended to be&nbsp;used by developers.<br>
        As useful and simple as possible.<br>
        It is the Workflow framework for a fast and readable code.
    </p>
    <p>Related or based on Monads.</p>
    <p>
        Tested by enterprise applications.<br>
        Saves a bulk of code in difficult cases.<br>
        Simple to maintain if your follow main practices (see examples below).<br>
        With all of that, it has unbelievable flexibility.<br>
        <br>
        WorkflowCode is sutable for state-full applications like the WPF, Silverlight, WinForms.<br>
        (I have some ideas for an ASP.NET version. But I think it's unreasonable)<br>
        <br>
        Be patient.<br>
        Study the examples.<br>
        And it will be for you an additional tool to deal with the complexity of the outside world.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Examples!</strong>

    <blockquote>Workflow patterns usually get applied in various context, hence the conditions for use shall be explicitly defined and shown in example to prevent from misinterpreting.
